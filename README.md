Standardized Testing Data (Confidential)

The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were not accurate and requested for updated data summaries in which we analyzed the data by eliminating outliers that may skew the data as was identified.  After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

Both math and reading data scores that were not holding the correct values or missing integers were replaced for the student records to assist with making the data more accurate.
