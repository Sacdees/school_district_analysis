Standardized Testing Data (Confidential)

The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were not accurate and requested for updated data summaries in which we analyzed the data by eliminating outliers that may skew the data as was identified.  After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

Both math and reading data scores that were not holding the correct values or missing integers were replaced for the student records to assist with making the data more accurate.

 # Summary-
  Overall, we were able to provide a great deal of knowledge in order to compare the different grades and school types.  By managing the data correctly we were able to adjust the representation for Thomas School to more closely fall in line with the rest of the school data provided.  This was by simply eliminating scores that either had an input error or had cell values that represents a "0".  This was causing the scores for Thomas school to appear much lower the other schools of similar size and origin.
